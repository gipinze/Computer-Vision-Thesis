This is an approach using Mediapipe as face feature extractor and CNN as Model, with an accuracy over 74% with 48 x 48 x 1 images, which can be improve in the future

This code is a modification from Jhan15/Facial_emotion_recognition (great implementation)

The differences here is that is easier to read, allow us to test accuracy with confussion matrix, with the classes and also, if you want to test the model with unseen images (another dataset) you can do it easily
