# This is a RepVGG Immplementation for face emotion recognition using different datasets and getting 60+% of accuracy with almost none changes

The most important part might be the class weighting strategy which has been extracted from Kaggle's number one emotion recognition model.

The model might have better accuracy with bigger images, as its possible to see in the results

The code is implemented to run with 2 gpus, but might be easy to delete those lines and run in with one or even with cpu
